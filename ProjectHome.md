'Open Cookbook' is a project to create and manage an online database/encyclopedia of meal/drink recipes.
Created and maintained by a community of cooking and bar enthusiasts, the database is available in an open format with no-charge royalty-free license to any user.
On top of the database, the project builds added-value services like recommendations, shopping lists and so on.
